# 42 - Minishell

## About
Minishell is a project from the 42-cursus curriculum that introduces students to the inner workings of Unix-like shells. The goal is to build a minimalist shell in C that mimics the behavior of Bash, handling user input, executing commands, and managing processes - all while respecting strict syntax and system-level constraints.

Students must implement features such as:
- Interactive prompt for command input
- Built-in commands like echo, cd, pwd, export, unset, env, and exit
- Redirections (>, >>, <) and pipes (|)
- Environment variable expansion
- Signal handling for Ctrl-C, Ctrl-D, and Ctrl-\
- Heredoc support (<<) for multi-line input

The project emphasizes robust parsing, process creation, and error handling, pushing students to understand how shells interpret and execute commands. Itâ€™s a deep dive into system programming, and a rite of passage for anyone serious about mastering OS-level development.

This repository is mostly just an archive of my studies, and can serve as a reference for future students in a time of need. However, I strongly encourage students to avoid just copy-pasting.

## Collaboration
Minishell project is a team effort and is currently being worked on by me and my classmate [Eduardo](https://github.com/EzLucca).
